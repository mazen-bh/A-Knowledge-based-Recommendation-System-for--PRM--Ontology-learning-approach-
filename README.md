The procedure of ontology construction can be done in one of three ways: manual construction; cooperative
construction (need the human intervention during the constructing process) and (semi-) automatic
construction which considered the Ontology Learning (OL) approach. OL from text is the process for
acquiring and representing knowledge from text [structured (database), semi-structured (XML file) and
unstructured (.txt, pdf, etc)] to be in machine-understandable form [OWL, RDF (Resource Description
Framework), or RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema)], by applying a set of methods and
techniques (NLP, data mining, and machine learning).


-Natural Language Processing via NLTK and Spacy matcher 
linguistic-based preprocessing technique: 
(1)Tokénization and normalization
(2) part-of –speech tagging (POS),
(3)posTagger,
(4) stopwords, Lemmatization (Stemming), 
(5) chunking. levenshetein measure, TF-IDF measure, leveithen measure, cosine similarity measure, topic modeling LDA, n-gram,
-Recommenadtions techniques based on ML : hiaachical clutering, classification, KNN, etc
-Performance measures: Precision, Recall and F measure,
-Programmation: Python, java;
-Semantic web language/Tool: OWL2, RDF and SWRL
